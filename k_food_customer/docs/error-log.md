# Error Log and Fixes

## WebSocket Communication Issues

### 1. Connection State Error

**Issue**: `InvalidStateError: send on WebSocket in CONNECTING state`  
**Cause**: Messages were being sent before WebSocket connection was fully established  
**Fix**: Implemented message queue and readyState checks

- Added `isReady` flag and message queue in WebSocketHandler
- Messages are now queued if connection isn't ready
- Queue is processed once connection is established
- Added reconnection handling with exponential backoff

### 2. Malformed WebSocket URL

**Issue**: Double slashes in WebSocket URL (`ws://127.0.0.1:5500//ws`)  
**Fix**: Corrected URL formation in WebSocketHandler constructor

- Now properly constructs URL using protocol, host, and port
- Validates URL components before connection
- Added error handling for malformed URLs

### 3. Unknown Message Types

**Issue**: Errors on receiving 'welcome' and 'ping' messages  
**Fix**: Enhanced message type handling

- Added explicit handling for common message types
- Implemented graceful fallback for unknown types
- Added logging for debugging purposes

## Modal Rendering Issues

### 1. Data Validation Error

**Issue**: `Error showing modal: Order data is missing or malformed`  
**Fix**: Added comprehensive data validation

- Validates all required data sections
- Checks data types and structure
- Provides meaningful error messages
- Falls back to safe defaults where appropriate

### 2. Undefined Property Access

**Issue**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'forEach')`  
**Fix**: Added defensive programming in modal rendering

- Added null checks for all data access
- Implemented safe container management
- Added fallback content for missing data
- Enhanced error reporting

## Form Submission Issues

### 1. DOM Element Access

**Issue**: `prepareOrderData(): Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'querySelector')`  
**Fix**: Added robust form element validation

- Added form instance validation
- Implemented safe field value retrieval
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Enhanced validation messages

### 2. Payment Method Validation

**Issue**: Broken payment method selection logic  
**Fix**: Enhanced payment validation

- Added explicit validation for payment inputs
- Implemented robust GCash number validation
- Added reference number format validation
- Enhanced error reporting for payment issues

- Added phone number format validation
- Enhanced required field checks

### 2. Order Data

- Added cart item structure validation
